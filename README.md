composer-changelogs is a plugin for Composer. It displays texts after
each Composer update to easily access changelogs for updated vendors.

## Installation

You can install it either locally:

```shell
composer require "pyrech/composer-changelogs"
```

or globally:

```shell
composer global require "pyrech/composer-changelogs"
```

## Usage

That's it! Composer will enable automatically the plugin as soon it's
installed. Just run your Composer updates as usual :)

If you no longer want to display changelogs, you can either:
- run your Composer command with the option `--no-plugins`
- uninstall the package
